# hello-world
This is my first repo. I'm doing the "Hello World" tutorial from github ( https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ ) and this is my first test with this platform!

Hi everyone! 
My name is lbsbezerra, and I'm going to do some testing here. This is my first "commit change" and I plan to do a second one where I remove the text of the second line here (the part with the "This is my first repo. I'm doing the..." blablabla)
